A* with enhanced navigation and planning algorithm it includes a GUI and a not so enhanced version. It navigated through all maps that have been tested succesfully.

**Execution**

Run the file Start.m with matlab

**video playlist with all the maps**

Videos for the PTMR-2018 repo maps from 8 to 9 all at x1 speed except map4 x2
The duration of each video is about 30s
